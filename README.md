# 📝 **Task Manager App**  

A **feature-rich** and **user-friendly** Flutter-based mobile application designed to help you efficiently manage your daily tasks. From creating and organizing to tracking your tasks, this app helps you stay productive and organized with ease.  

---

## 📊 **Project Overview**  

The **Task Manager App** allows users to create, prioritize, and track their tasks effectively. With advanced features such as filtering, sorting, dark/light mode support, and persistent settings, this app offers a flexible and streamlined experience for personal productivity.

Developed using **Flutter**, **Riverpod** for state management, and **Hive** for local storage, the app ensures smooth performance and a clean user interface that follows **Material Design** principles.

## 🌟 **Key Features**  

- **Task Management**  
  - Add new tasks with title, due date, and priority level (High, Medium, Low).  
  - Edit and update existing tasks.  
  - Mark tasks as **Completed** or **Pending** with one tap.  
  - Delete tasks when no longer needed.  

- **Filtering**  
  - View tasks based on different filters:  
    - **All** – Display all tasks.  
    - **Completed** – Show only completed tasks.  
    - **Pending** – Show only tasks that are pending.  

- **Sorting**  
  - Sort tasks by:  
    - **Due Date** – In ascending or descending order.  
    - **Priority** – Higher priority tasks are displayed first.  
    - **Status** – Completed tasks appear last.  

- **Dark/Light Mode**  
  - Toggle between **dark** and **light** modes for a comfortable viewing experience.  

- **Persistent Settings**  
  - User preferences such as default filter, sort order, and theme mode are saved locally using **Hive**.  

- **Responsive Design**  
  - Adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes and orientations for a consistent experience.

## 🛠️ **Technologies Used**  

- **Flutter** – Cross-platform framework for building natively compiled apps.  
- **Riverpod** – State management library for maintaining app-wide and widget-specific states.  
- **Hive** – Lightweight, NoSQL database for local data persistence.  
- **Material Design** – For a polished and consistent user interface.  
- **Dart** – The programming language used to build the app.

## 🚀 **How It Works**  

1. **Adding a Task**  
   - Tap the "+" button on the **Task List Screen** to navigate to the **Add Task Screen**.  
   - Enter the task title, select the due date, and choose the priority level before saving.  

2. **Managing Tasks**  
   - The **Task List Screen** displays all tasks.  
   - Swipe left to delete a task or tap to mark it as completed or pending.  

3. **Filtering and Sorting**  
   - Tap the **filter icon** to filter tasks by status and sort them based on due date, priority, or completion status.  

4. **Changing Settings**  
   - The **Settings Screen** allows users to toggle between dark and light mode, set default filters, and adjust sorting preferences.  

5. **Persisting Data**  
   - All tasks and user preferences are stored locally in **Hive** to persist data across app restarts.
